I've built a streamlined API with Express.js on Node.js, designed for seamless management of user data. This project demonstrates a robust, in-memory implementation to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on users via API endpoints. Whether youâ€™re retrieving all users, adding a new user, modifying details, or deleting records, nod delivers simplicity and efficiency.

Key Features:
Retrieve All Users: Fetch comprehensive user data with ease.
Add New Users: Seamlessly add user records with car details.
Update Existing Users: Modify user information dynamically.
Delete Users: Effortlessly remove user records.
Why Choose nod?
Crafted with precision and adhering to best practices, nod serves as a perfect foundation for developers looking to build or extend RESTful APIs. Its intuitive design ensures it's equally suitable for beginners exploring backend development and seasoned pros refining their API skills.
